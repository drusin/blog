    <p>A collection of small and humorous things from my 2nd baby's first few weeks that I wanted to write down.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: <em>Everything below is 100% based on my very own and very privileged experiences of having a healthy baby that sleeps well.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Newborn poo comes out with the force of a thousand suns</li>
<li>Farts also come out with the force of a thousand suns</li>
<li>A big challenge during breast feeding is to make sure the baby doesn't fall asleep too early, otherwise it will wake up hungry in 5-15min again.</li>
<li><em>Story from the hospital, day after the birth:</em> Nurse asks my wife (in regards to breast feeding) if her breasts have become larger. My wife responds with something like <em>&quot;maybe&quot;</em>, <em>&quot;I guess so...&quot;</em>. Apparently the nurse needed a more decisive answer, because she then addressed the no. 1 fan of my wife's boobies (me) - after an energetic nod from my side, the nurse was more satisfied</li>
<li>The most important baby toy that we own is an over 50 years old rattle in the shape of a ladybug. The sound it makes and the contrasting colours on it are the best way to keep our newborn from crying while changing the diaper</li>
<li>For the first few days after birth, our newborn looked like Baby Yoda</li>
<li>The newborn looks very similar to his now 4 years old brother, when he was its age</li>
<li>There are already so many indications (starting at the first seconds of his live) of the newborn being a very different person compared to his brother - it is crazy that two boys from the same parents with only 4 years between them are so different from each other from the birth on...</li>
</ul>
