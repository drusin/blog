    <p>Morrigan Crow is a cursed, almost 11 years old, child. As all cursed children in the Wintersea Republic, she is responsible for all accidents, mishaps und bad luck in her vicinity. Also, as all cursed children, she is supposed to die on her upcoming birthday.</p>
<p>But, as she is the main character in the currently 3 books spanning series, that obviously doesn't happen. Instead, she escapes into the magical land of Evermoor. There she encounters huge talking cats, Wunimals (animal-like creatures with human intelligence), school drama and problems with the immigration office. Morrigan becomes best friends with a boy who loves to ride dragons and, of course, she has to face <em>The Antagonist</em> - a dark figure everyone only refers to as The Wondersmith.</p>
<h2>That sounds pretty similar to a very popular book / film series, doesn't it?</h2>
<p>Yes, there are a lot of parallels to the Harry Potter series - a cursed child, who has some unknown potential, with very shitty family and uncanny bonds with the main antagonist.</p>
<h3>Some backstory: The Harry Potter series and me</h3>
<details>
  <summary>
    I was a huge Harry Potter fan once, but... (click here to expand the backstory)
  </summary>
<p><em><strong>Preface:</strong></em> <em>I'm just providing some context for the rest of this blog post. I don't want to debate Rowling's views, the quality of her writing or the ethics of buying or enjoying Harry Potter/Wizarding World products.</em></p>
<p>I was a <strong>huge</strong> fan of the Harry Potter books. When a distant aunt from the USA visiting my grandma gifted me the first Harry Potter book, I was instantly hooked and sucked in into this magical world. Also I was the exact age that Harry was when he got the Hogwarts letter, which made the immersion even larger.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I met different people in high school, job, and online. I got exposed to different views, opinions, cultures - basically I expanded my horizon and grew as a person. More and more elements of the Harry Potter series started rubbing me the wrong way. The more obvious aspects are, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commonly accepted slavery of house elves</li>
<li>Very obvious classism and racism integrated into the culture</li>
<li>Goblins looking like antisemitic caricatures running the wizard bank (although one could argue that that's just following the common characterization of goblins since at least Tolkien's The Hobbit)</li>
</ul>
<p>But to be honest, these are some problematic aspects in a large book series that I adored, and were not enough to make me fall out of love with it.<br>
What made me fall out of love with the Harry Potter series, is that...</p>
<ol>
<li>J. K. Rowling is a huge transphobe</li>
<li>She uses her huge amount of money and reach to spread her transphobia</li>
<li>Every time someone buys something Harry Potter/Wizarding World related, money goes her way</li>
<li>(point 3. is why &quot;death of the author&quot; doesn't work for me here)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Backstory over ;)</em></p>
</details>
<h2>What I enjoyed in the Newvemoor book series</h2>
<p>First and foremost - the atmosphere. It was really for the first time since reading the first Harry Potter book as a child that I felt sucked into this magical and wondrous world. I wanted to know every detail about the society, customs, creatures, etc.<br>
I found Morrigan to be a very likable character, her actions, reactions, thoughts and feelings were very understandable for me.<br>
There are a lot of interesting characters - many are likable, many are mysterious, some are unlikable - but none of them are boring.<br>
The book series is well written, has a pretty good story, and well thought out story- and character-arcs.</p>
<h2>What was not so great</h2>
<p>There were a few parts, especially in the first book, that felt directly pulled from the Harry Potter books. Nothing major, just some very clear influences.<br>
I'm waiting for the fourth installment since 2022... It was postponed twice already, let's see how it looks in September 2024... Mrs. Townsend, please hurry up and give me my closure!<br>
Also I would say that the books get darker in general. While the first one has a lot of &quot;feel good&quot; passages, the third one e.g. has the pressure and huge stakes present through most of the story - not per say bad, just something to be aware of.</p>
<h2>How is the audio book?</h2>
<p>It's good :)<br>
I listened to the English version read by Gemma Whelan. It is not a full dramatization, so no sound effects, no additional actors. The performance is really solid, nothing to critique here.<br>
I also heard a few bits of the German audiobook, read by Hans LÃ¶w. It is quite solid, but I think a female voice suits a story that closely follows the antics of an 11 years old girl way better..</p>
<h2>So why should I read this instead of Harry Potter?</h2>
<ol>
<li>It's a new, different, and awesome story. No one is taking Harry Potter away from you, and I think that most Potterheads will really enjoy the trip to Nevermoor</li>
<li>It is not written by a huge transphobe</li>
<li>The child main character is not forced to their abusive family at the end of every book and has to deal with them at the beginning of the next one, which is a huge plus in my book</li>
<li>The main antagonist is more interesting and more nuanced than &quot;I want to rule the world&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>If you like fantasy, and want to explore a new magical world through the eyes of an 11 years old cursed child - It's an awesome book series and I warmly recommend it. The first book in the series is titled <strong>&quot;Nevermoor: The Trials of Morrigan Crow&quot;</strong> and you can find it in most places that sell books or audio books.</p>
