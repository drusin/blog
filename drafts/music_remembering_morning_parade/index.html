Hello monday morning, try and talk your way out of this one

<p>Morning Parade was a five-piece alternative rock band from England. The band formed in 2007, release two albums, and dissolved in 2014. I really like their music and was very sad when I read about their breakup on Facebook.</p>
</p>
<h2>How did I find them (or did they find me?)</h2>
<p>Morning parade were one of two opening acts during a 30 Seconds to Mars concert I visited in 2011, and they were better than the main act. Their songs really &quot;clicked&quot; with me immediately, it felt like I knew where some songs were going although it was my first time hearing them. And that's not because they were uninspired or common, as one might think, they just directly felt... familiar, in the best sense of the word.</p>
<h2>What does Morning Parade sound like</h2>
<p>To be honest, I took the &quot;alternative rock&quot; label from their Wikipedia article.</p>
