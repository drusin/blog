    <p>The Ninth House is not a nice place to live. The climate is harsh, the soil grows almost nothing, the day and night cycle takes months. One is surrounded by a small, aging population and by animated skeletons that take care of manual work. And when someone does of old age or illness, their skeleton is reanimated through necromancy and joins the ranks of brainless workers.<br>
Gideon is an 18 years old orphan and foundling, and wants to get off the planet for good. The only other person her age on the entire planet is Harrowhark Nonagesimus, a necromantic nun and heir to the Ninth House. Also, she hates Gideon and Gideon hates her, with a fiery passion.<br>
On the day of Gideon's 87th attempt at escaping the planet, a correspondence from the <strong>Emperor All-Giving, Necrolord Prime, Resurrection, King Undying</strong>, or, a bit shorter and to-the-point - a correspondence from <strong>God</strong>, reaches the Ninth House and links the fates of both young women together, forcing them to cooperate.</p>
<h2>Content warning?</h2>
<p>This series contains a lot of (sometimes quite graphical) violence, a lot of swearing and some gore or body horror (it's about necromancers after all). It also deals with trauma, self-harm and suicide.</p>
<h3>You should know your anatomy vocabulary (or be prepared to look it up)</h3>
<p>Sometimes very specific bones, muscles, organs or body parts are mentioned, used or described. I read the first book in German and was fine most of the time, but the second one in English and struggled a bit with this specific vocabulary.</p>
<h2>What?</h2>
<p>The Locked Tomb is a series of dystopian adult science fantasy books by Tamsyn Muir. It takes place about ten thousand years in the future, probably in a part of the milky way, and necromancy in many different forms is running the world. The fourth and final book <strong>Alecto the Ninth</strong> is expected to release somewhen 2024.</p>
<h2>Let's talk about the books one by one:</h2>
<h3>Book 1: Gideon the Ninth</h3>
<p>This is the start of the story. We get to know the protagonist, Gideon, as an edgy and foul mouthed teenager who despises everything about her current life and her surroundings. And it's understandable - there is literally one person on the entire planet who doesn't despise her, she doesn't belong there and is not at all interested in the necromantic cult ruling the Ninth House. I found it quite easy to sympathize with her and understand her motives and deeds.</p>
<p>The book starts out in the middle of a situation, resolves it, drops you into a way bigger situation and starts with world building, lore, and more world building. It really takes its time until stuff starts happening again - this is a common occurrence in all the Locked Tomb books. <strong>But it pays off</strong> - the lore combined with the really intriguing plot (after it finally gets going) result in a super interesting and complex book that I want to re-read again soon to get all then little (and maybe not so little) intricacies I missed the first time - this is also a common occurrence in all the Locked Tomb books.</p>
<h4>What did I like</h4>
<ul>
<li>I love the world and its lore - it's very intriguing to me and surprised me often.</li>
<li>I really like the main protagonist</li>
<li>Character arc galore: in this book you get to know Gideon and 15 more characters, who all star out very one dimensional. You get to know a lot more about almost of all them, and a substantial amount of them experiences a very well written character arc. It's really fun to follow them and see them grow.</li>
<li><strong>The ending is awesome</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>What I did not like</h4>
<ul>
<li>Well, for about the first fifth of the book I wasn't sure if I like it because of all the world building - but it payed off in the end</li>
<li>There is one specific instance of a key character acting very against their character development that really rubbed me the wrong way. It get's glossed over and it feels like the rest of the cast acts as if it did not happen a few pages later - I don't think the story gained anything by having it in. Overall not a huge deal, but I was quite pissed of for a few pages.</li>
<li>The main character could be described as very &quot;edgy&quot;, which sets the tone for most of the book - I think it fits quite well, but might be a turn off for some</li>
</ul>
<h4>You should read it</h4>
<p>If you don't mind the things mentioned in the content warning, and can deal with a lot of exposition and the edginess of a 17 years old who grew up on a barren planet, surrounded by old people, necromancers and skeletons, I <strong>highly recommend this book</strong>! And, besides all the good things I mentioned before that await you in it, after you finished reading, another awesome thing is waiting for you:</p>
<h3>Book 2: Harrow the Ninth</h3>
