    <p>The Ninth House of the Necrolord's empire is not a nice place to live. The climate is harsh, the soil grows almost nothing, the day and night cycle takes months. One is surrounded by a small, aging population and by animated skeletons that take care of manual work. And when someone does of old age or illness, their skeleton is reanimated through necromancy and joins the ranks of brainless workers.<br>
Gideon is an 18 years old orphan and foundling, and wants to get off the planet for good. The only other person her age on the entire planet is Harrowhark Nonagesimus, a necromantic nun and heir to the Ninth House. Also, she hates Gideon and Gideon hates her, with a fiery passion.<br>
On the day of Gideon's 87th attempt at escaping the planet, a correspondence from the <strong>Emperor All-Giving, Necrolord Prime, Resurrection, King Undying</strong>, or, a bit shorter and to-the-point - a correspondence from <strong>God</strong>, reaches the Ninth House and links the fates of both young women together, forcing them to cooperate.</p>
<h2>What?</h2>
<p>The Locked Tomb is a series of dystopian adult science fantasy books by Tamsyn Muir, focusing on necromancy. It takes place about ten thousand years in the future, probably in a part of the milky way. The fourth and final book <strong>Alecto the Ninth</strong> is expected to release somewhen 2024.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the books one by one:</p>
<h2>Gideon the Ninth</h2>
<p>This is the start of the story. We get to know the protagonist, Gideon, as an edgy and foul mouthed teenager who despises everything about her current life and her surroundings. And it's understandable - there is literally one person on the entire planet who doesn't despise her, she doesn't belong there and is not at all interested in the necromantic cult going on over there.</p>
