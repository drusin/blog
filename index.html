                <p>Personal Knowledge Management tools are there to help you collect, combine, query and visualize your thoughts, notes and memories. If used correctly, this leads to a personal knowledge database that you can use as a &quot;second brain&quot;. Store notes and information in a way that makes it easy to find and create cross references between them. Usually those tools also have a visualization feature which results in a graph that looks a lot like neurons connected with synapses.<br>
In this post I'll share my brief experiences with the three PKM tools I tried out: Dendron, Foam and Logseq.

<p>Morning Parade was a five-piece alternative rock band from England. The band formed in 2007, released two albums, and dissolved in 2014. I really like their music and was heartbroken when they announced their breakup on Facebook.

                <p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> is an awesome (and super fast) static site generator and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is a nice and free way to host a static website. The <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/deployment/">11ty Deployment Documentation</a> even mentions GitHub Pages, but doesn't document the small config changes you have to do to make your 11ty page work there. This post goes over two 11ty setups for GitHub Pages: one simple but a bit clunky, and one slightly more involved but also more comfortable in the end.
