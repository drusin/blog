A collection of small and humorous things from my 2nd baby's first few weeks that I wanted to write down.

**Warning**: _Everything below is 100% based on my very own and very privileged experiences of having a healthy baby that sleeps well._

* Newborn poo comes out with the force of a thousand suns
* Farts also come out with the force of a thousand suns
* A big challenge during breast feeding is to make sure the baby doesn't fall asleep too early, otherwise it will wake up hungry in 5-15min again.
* _Story from the hospital, day after the birth:_ Nurse asks my wife (in regards to breast feeding) if her breasts have become larger. My wife responds with something like _"maybe"_, _"I guess so..."_. Apparently the nurse needed a more decisive answer, because she then addressed the no. 1 fan of my wife's boobies (me) - after an energetic nod from my side, the nurse was more satisfied
* The most important baby toy that we own is an over 50 years old rattle in the shape of a ladybug. The sound it makes and the contrasting colours on it are the best way to keep our newborn from crying while changing the diaper
* For the first few days after birth, our newborn looked like Baby Yoda
* The newborn looks very similar to his now 4 years old brother, when he was its age
* There are already so many indications (starting at the first seconds of his live) of the newborn being a very different person compared to his brother - it is crazy that two boys from the same parents with only 4 years between them are so different from each other from the birth on...
