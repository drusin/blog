## Albums

### Pablo Honey
I, like the rest of the world, know one song of this album - Creep. I don't know any other songs, so let's talk about this one:

* __Creep__ ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFkzRNyygfk), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/track/70LcF31zb1H0PyJoS1Sx1r?si=bf58370464164481)): The song that makes a bunch of people think of Radiohead as a one hit wonder - it catapulted the band to way more fame than they were comfortable with.... 

### The Bends
I don't know one song of the album. Next! 

### OK Computer
This is it. This is _The Album_, the one that cemented Radiohead as The Gods Of Alternative Rock. If you want to give exactly one Radiohead album a go, __this one should be it__. It's the most popular Radiohead album on Spotify and its songs occupy spot 2 and 3 on the band's most streamed list.

### The King of Limbs
This is probably the most divisive album amongst Radiohead fans. The whole album has a very experimental premise: every song started out as a loop that one of the band members made that then got turned into a full song. I quite like two songs, but not the album versions. 
* __Bloom__ ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxBQ8Er8DYc&pp=ygUPcmFkaW9oZWFkIGJsb29t), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/track/2HO0MwfNYxJa2zwo6vrQMT?si=2af01bed91914da1)): 
* __Give Up The Ghost__ ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGGb7o7EbFs&pp=ygUbcmFkaW9oZWFkIGdpdmUgdXAgdGhlIGdob3N0), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/track/05NZMYuLR71Z3qrZOUiUm2?si=a7e029131e324be5)): One of the most beautiful Radiohead songs, at least in my opinion. Acoustic guitar, very light drum machine, a vocal loop and Thom Yorke's angle like singing. I love the "live from the basement" version, linked below.

Please tell me that sounded alright

### A Moon Shaped Pool
An overall loved album by the fans and a great return to form for those who hated _The King of Limbs_. I... like two songs:
* __Burn the Witch__ ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI2oS2hoL0k&pp=ygUYcmFkaW9oZWFkIGJ1cm4gdGhlIHdpdGNo), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/track/3DpuYpzkvUWXbmzCm6pfzR?si=0062034c417348e9)): Best album opener (3/3) - nice and sweet vocals, paired with dark lyrics and dissonant strings. This is one of the songs I wouldn't mind listening to on repeat. The stop motion music video in the style of a preschool children's series about visiting a cult-run village is really awesome. 
* __Ful Stop__ ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHDOk7lA53w&pp=ygUScmFkaW9oZWFkIGZ1bCBzdG9w), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/track/6nOsTV3cMjLh3k6Wpk468L?si=8a4f300a190049ba)): No, It's not a typo. The song starts as a dark techno track with some spoken lines in 6/4 (at least that's how I feel it), then opens up and adds real drums, light guitars and vocals. There is multimeter, interesting harmonies and different parallel vocal lines. Not a lot of lyrics but a lot of atmosphere.
